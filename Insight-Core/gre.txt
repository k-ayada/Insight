I took internet connection with BBNL (via operator NGU ELAN SOLUTIONS PVT LTD) on 5th July 2017  (user id: 648c61) for 1 year by paying Rs.14160 ( 1000+180 per month). I was facing to poor quality of service and frequent connection drops. Even after repeated requests and complaints, I was not provided satisfactory service. I requested the service provider to cancel the connection and refund the money (ticket: 20171029115733). So far both BBNL and NGU has not refunded our money. I've already raised complaint in consumerhelpline.gov.in (508635) and have sent notice to BBNL via email and speed post. BBNL has not accepted the post not has replied to my emails. As a next step, the consumer helpline officer asked me to raise complaint in this website.
